<div class="about-link-text">
**Hi/Kia Ora/你好!**<br>
 <br>
I'm a postdoctoral biostatistician at the [Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mcri.edu.au/research/research-areas/population-health/clinical-epidemiology-biostatistics-cebu), Murdoch Children's Research Institute, working under the supervision of Professor [Margarita Moreno-Betancur](https://moreno-betancur.github.io/). My primary research focus is on developing and evaluating model-free causal machine learning methods. 

I earned my PhD in Statistics from the University of Auckland under the supervision of Professor [Thomas Lumley](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-lumley), where I developed strategies to choose the best possible subsample to gather information in medical research more efficiently. This approach is being applied in studies of electronic health records and HIV research studies in developing countries. In that time, I was also the main developer of [iNZight](https://inzight.nz/) [Lite](https://lite.docker.stat.auckland.ac.nz/) project.
