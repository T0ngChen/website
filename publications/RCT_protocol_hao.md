 Soft tissue defect is commonly seen in immediate maxillary posterior implantation because of tooth extraction wound and tension from bone graft. Bone graft materials exposure has significant detrimental influence on bone augmentation. However, previous studies lack sufficient evidence to guide wound closure after immediate posterior implantation. This study aims to use 3D integration technology to evaluate the effect of porcine collagen matrix versus rotated pedicle palatal connective tissue flap (RPPCTF) on the soft tissue closure after the immediate maxillary posterior implantation.
