<div class="about-link-text">
**Hi/Kia Ora/你好!**<br>
 <br>
I'm a postdoctoral biostatistician at [Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mcri.edu.au/research/research-areas/population-health/clinical-epidemiology-biostatistics-cebu), Murdoch Children's Research Institute, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Margarita Moreno-Betancur](https://moreno-betancur.github.io/). I obtained my PhD in Statistics from the University of Auckland, under the supervision of Professor [Thomas Lumley](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-lumley), where I developed strategies to choose the best possible subsample to gather information in medical research more efficiently. This approach is being applied in studies of electronic health records and HIV research studies in developing countries. In that time, I was also the main developer of [iNZight](https://inzight.nz/) [Lite](https://lite.docker.stat.auckland.ac.nz/) project.


My research interests have been largely shaped by my experiences throughout my PhD and post-doctoral research. I am interested in developing efficient, robust, and model-free causal machine learning methods specifically tailored for high-dimensional mediation problems within medical research. Additionally, I am interested in developing the optimal design and analysis methods for complex surveys. A further aspect of my interest lies in the development of open-source software, aiming to foster greater reproducibility in data science.
