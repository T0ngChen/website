Excessive maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) is strongly correlated with childhood obesity, yet how excess maternal weight gain and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) interact to affect early childhood obesity is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether overall and trimester-specific maternal GWG and GDM were associated with obesity in offspring by age 6 years.
